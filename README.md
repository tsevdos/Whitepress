# Whitepress theme #

Whitepress is a minimalistic and lightweight Wordpress theme. For information/support please have a look at [theme's official page](http://www.tsevdos.com/whitepress-theme/ "Whitepress theme").

## Theme Features ##

- Super clean and minimalistic design
- Really lightweight theme! The generated code (including files and images) is less than 40K
- Structured and valid web standards code (XHTML and CSS)
- Very flexible customization (typography, sidebar, etc.)
- Widget-ready sidebar. The sidebar has many AJAX-like effects that minimizes vertical space
- Gravatar support for comments (from wordpress 2.5 and above)
- Print-only style
- Progressive Enhancement! The site is functional even when Javascript is turned off. The content is accessible to all users including text-only browsers and screen readers
- Ready to use jQuery library (version 1.2.6), for further enchantment and development
- Works in all modern browsers (including Firefox 2 and 3, Internet Explorer 6 and 7, Opera, Safari and Chrome)
- Compatible with WordPress 2.5

## Installation Instructions ##

Just upload the "whitepress" folder into your blogâ€™s **themes directory** (located under the **"wp-content" directory**) and activate it from the Design tab (Wordpress 2.5 and above) or Presentation tab (Wordpress 2 and below).

## Support ##

Please keep in mind that I developed this theme back in 2008 so it's a bit out-of-date. I'm not planning to support it anymore, although feel free to fork it and update it (unfortunately I don't have the time to do it).
